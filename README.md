Titanic-Challenge
=================
This Repo contains work done as part of final assignment for TU Delft's Fundamentals of Data Analytics Course.
I tried to explore Titanic data set provided by Kaggle's Titanic Challenge, created features and finally did a performance 
evaluation of 5 algorithms( Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, Decision Trees and Random Forests) on this data set.
The final copy.pdf in Final Report directory reports all this work.
